# COVID-19 in Mexico: A network of coexisting epidemics. 



The COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico is the result of several simultaneous epidemic dynamics occuring simultaneously. Patterns of interdependence arise, that may be driven by complex underlying phenomena. 

### In this work, a network that captures the statistical dependence between epidemic processes in each of the municipalities in Mexico

1) Data is acquired from the federal government open data platform [https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/datos-abiertos-bases-historicas-direccion-general-de-epidemiologia]

2) The daily new cases time series for each municipality is extracted, and normalized by population.

3) Time series are discretized, and for each pair of municipalities, Mutual Information is calculated and normalized.

4) The MI matrix is discretized, keeping links with MI higher than 0.5, resulting in a network object

5) Network analysis, including module detection using the Louvain algorithm, is performed.
